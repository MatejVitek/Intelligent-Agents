# Intelligent-Agents
A Unity3D project for development, testing and comparison of intelligent agents that simulate human-like behaviour.

It uses the freely available [Viking Village](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/29140) and [Cartoon Weapon Pack](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/23956) to help with the creation of the world.

The full project (along with a working build) is available at <https://www.dropbox.com/s/ht8buz2spcbykad/Intelligent%20Agents.zip?dl=0>.

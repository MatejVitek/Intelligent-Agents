# Intelligent-Agents
A Unity3D project for development, testing and comparison of intelligent agents that simulate human-like behaviour.

It uses the freely available [Viking Village](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/29140) and [Cartoon Weapon Pack](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/23956) to help with the creation of the world.

For a link to the full project (along with a working build), consult the [project wiki](https://github.com/MatejVitek/Intelligent-Agents/wiki).

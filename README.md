# Intelligent-Agents
A Unity3D project for development, testing and comparison of intelligent agents that simulate human-like behaviour.

It uses the freely available Viking Village (<https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/29140>) and Cartoon Weapon Pack (<https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/23956>) to help with the creation of the world.

The full project (along with a working build) is available at <https://www.dropbox.com/s/7nx2erqo1t40744/Intelligent%20Agents.zip?dl=0>.
